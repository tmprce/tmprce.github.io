  <p> Welcome! I am a 3rd Year PhD student at the University of Warwick, under the supervision of John Greenlees. I am interested in stable homotopy theory, especially its interactions with commutative algebra, more recently in an equivariant context.</p>

	<i>The Nucleus of a Compact Lie Group, and Support of Singularity Categories</i> (2024) in the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra (<a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpaa.2024.107780>link</a>)
	Be aware there is a typo in prop. 2.6: in condition iii) one should replace C_G(H)/T with the Weyl group of T in C_G(H). Thanks to Dave Benson for spotting the error!
