<h1 style="padding:10px">Tom Peirce: Errata</h1>
I will list here any mistakes in talks and papers.
<ul>
<li> In my <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpaa.2024.107780>Nucleus paper</a>, there is a typo in Proposition 2.6, condition iii): instead of $C_G(H)/T$ one should have the Weyl group of $T$ in $C_G(H)$. I think in an earlier draft I was assuming $T$ was normal in $G$ (which one <i>can</i> do), but as written it makes no sense. Thanks to Dave Benson for spotting and pointing this out!</li>
<li> If anyone noticed in my UK Prague talk: I claimed the derived category of quasicoherant sheaves on a quasicompact quasiseparated scheme is rigidly-compactly generated. Of course, I require the subcategory of those sheaves with quasicoherent cohomology, and that's only the whole category if my scheme is separated. I apologise.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Non-Errors</h3>

    <li> My surname is in fact spelt Peirce, not Pierce.</li>
